Shiny Foundation on Rails
=======================

A working example using [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) front-end on Rails. This showcase demonstrates basic CRUD implemented in Rails.
This is a quick and a bit dirty demo, intended to ba a start pont for development and discussions as well as help others to get into coding faster. There's a _lot_ of work TODO though.

Inspired by [Michael Hartl's tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org).

Pull requests are welcome!

## Database structure

## TODO:

- Expand this Readme.md to explain used gems and basic work flows.
- Fix my noobish css/scss structures (make common scss, e.g. colors.scss)
- Add search glass icon and make it stick to the search form.
- Replace search with Ransack's search form and add search logic.
- Make an image preview in add dialog.
- Lastly, add search filters in main feed.
